# Browser statics
As a web developer we need our websites work in all devices and browsers. So as a part of that we use reponsive design so that website can be access through devices of all size but we donot keep much focus on different browsers.  
In this project we are going to extract browser statics from w3schools and plot data to understand in much easier way so that we can use those statics for making our website much better.
